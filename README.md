# Explaining Loan Default in Microfinance
## Case Study 1 - Team 12

Through this analysis, we will quantify the relationships between various sociodemographic and geographic factors to both risk of default and time to default during the period 2005-2012. These quantified relationships will help inform potential investors in Kiva and other microfinance institutions with the same lending model by estimating the probability of default in this time period.
